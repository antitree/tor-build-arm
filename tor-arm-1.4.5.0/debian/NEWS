tor-arm (1.4.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
 
  Besides normal bug fixing and some minor features, this release introduces
   two mayor and interesting huge features:
   - Control Socket support
   - Control Port interpretor
  . 
  Having "Control Socket" enabled by default on Tor package lets us to 
   turn to almost zero configuration required for arm users to run Tor
  .
  This means we are be able to speak, through a local Unix socket, with Tor
   directly with no extra authentication required
  .
  Although this could appear to be frightening, basic POSIX permissions 
   are still required to access this socket, which, except in the case 
   you screw up your system, is fair enough
  . 
  To put things into perspective, most of all services on your system, even
  the more sensible ones, have been secured this way over many decades, 
  so don't get stressed out! :-)
  .
  In rlation to Control Port interpretor, this is a new page or standalone 
  prompt that gives raw control port access with several usability 
  improvements, between others:
  .
  - Tab completion
  - History scrollback
  - IRC-styled commands:
    * /help option which provides usage information for all of the tor/interpretor commands and tor configuration options
    * /info option for querying relay information via fingerprint, nickname, or IP address
    * /find option which searches the backlog for the given regex
    * /events option which displays any events that we've listened for
    * /write option which dumps the interpretor backlog to a file
