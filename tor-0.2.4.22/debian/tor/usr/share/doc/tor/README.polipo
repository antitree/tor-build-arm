Polipo is a http proxy that makes it easer to use Tor with a browser.

In order to make polipo use Tor, add the following to /etc/polipo/config:
    socksParentProxy = localhost:9050
    socksProxyType = socks5
You should then point your browser at localhost:8123 .

If you are concerned about cached data remaining on your disk, you
should also add
    diskCacheRoot=
